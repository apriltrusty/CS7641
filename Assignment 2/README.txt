To run experiments and produce all graphs, Excel experiment results, and terminal output results, run:

python3 four_peaks.py
python3 one_max.py
python3 max_k_color.py
python3 nn.py

You will need to have the following libraries installed:
    mlrose-hiive
    scikit-learn
    matplotlib
    numpy
    pandas
    scipy
    networkx
    openpyxl (for writing Excel files)

    
Also, please note that generating all results may take quite some time, and plots and Excel files will be saved to the directory from which you run this code.
