To run experiments and produce all graphs, Excel experiment results, and terminal output results, run:

python3 a3.py

You will need to have the following libraries installed:
    scikit-learn
    matplotlib
    numpy
    pandas
    scipy
    openpyxl (for writing Excel files)
    seaborn
    yellowbrick

    
Also, please note that generating all results may take quite some time, and plots and Excel files will 
be saved to the directory from which you run this code.

To save files, you may need to create the directory structure that the code is expecting.

Some of the code in a3.py is sourced from/based on the following:
